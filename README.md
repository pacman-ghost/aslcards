# ASL Cards

If you're a fan of [ASL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Squad_Leader), then Chris Edward's [ASL Cards](http://aslcards.com) are a useful play tool. He provides PDF's with data cards for every AFV and Gun in the system, which are handy to reference as you play a scenario.

However, unless you print them out, it's difficult to quickly switch between the ones you want, so I wrote this program that lets you pick out the ones you want, with a tabbed viewer that lets you quickly flip between them.

### Analyzing the PDF files

Simply point to the directory where the files live, and click Analyze. This process can take some time to run, ~5-10 minutes at the lowest resolution, ~1 hour at the highest.

### Selecting cards
